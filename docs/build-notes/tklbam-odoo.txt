TKLBAM is a great feature of Turnkey Linux Appliances.
Use it.  Test it.  Use i some more.

Backups are easy.

Restores can be more difficult.

After Restore you will want to restore your IP Number directly.
If, however, you are not using "Full CERTS" you will get a whole bunch of "error" messages asking you to accept an "insecure site".

To alleviate this it is important to CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE, so that the "accepted" cert doesn't appear "forged".  You have indeed thrown over to a new server (which appears like forgery) .  The issue being that each TKL build generates very secure "certs" that have different fingerprints.  TKLBAM, to our understanding, does not writer over these Fingerprints.

If you flush your BROWSER CACHE your acceptance of the "unsigned" cert will be happy as before.

We will update this document as we generate more experience (up until press time).
