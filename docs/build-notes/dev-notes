  Development notes below were written in the develoment process.  Can be dated by ISO build dates but are not there now.  RC's, V's etc are general descriptions at this point.

* As of v10 TKL-Nomadic-Connector  (known also as TKL-Nomadic-Odoo)  Will become RC3  (Should be dated by ISO Build)

  Added Directory Browsing and Docs Link from WebConsole

  Made WebConsole route in HTTPS and HTTP

  Added full pulls for Magento API (OpenLabs) into ISO

  Added full pulls for OCA / Connector into ISO
  
  Reintegrate InitFirstBoot for openuser account (postgresql user and odoo-server.conf setting) (TEST)

tkl-nomadic-odoo - 14 (RC2)  Implemented wkhtmltox in build.  changed console screens to adminer etc.

 * LAPP Appliance massaged into Odoo Appliance
 * Odoo Proxy set to work on ports 80 (redirected to SSL 443) and Odoo Native 8069

  * Changed Turnkey web control panel to use SERVER_NAME
    #  (original change)  displaying correct host when behind proxy (SERVER_ADDR -> HTTP_HOST).
    mofified now in index.php to work properly in this build to create effective Console (default port 12325)
    (HTTP_HOST -> SERVER_NAME)
  
  * significant changes to conf and host file structures
  
  * git clone restricted to --depth-1  (shrinks build significantly)
    should be able to continue with successive pulls but needs to be tested or perhaps reconfigured.
