Odoo Appliance - Turnkey Linux  
=======================
At beta v 01 (see release here and available as ISO on https://sourceforge.net/projects/tklnomadicodoo/  )

`Odoo`_ is a suite of web based open source business apps.  TKL-Nomadic-Odoo is a prebuilt install that integrates the current Odoo 8.0 Branch, and which has been preconfigured with Odoo Community Association Addon Modules - both OCA-Server Tools and the OCA - Magento Connector (Connector framework).

About Odoo.
It's main apps include an `Open Source CRM`_, `Website Builder`_, `eCommerce`_, `Project Management`_, `Billing and Accounting`_, `Point of Sale`_, `Human Resources`_, Marketing, Manufacturing, Purchase Management, ...  Each application is standalone but you get a full featured `Open Source ERP`_ if you install several apps as they integrate to each others.

This appliance is based on the Turnkeylinux (TKL) `LAPP stack`_, which integrates Linux, Apache Web, and PostgreSQL and includes all the standard features in `TurnKey Core`_, and on top of that:

- SSL support out of the box.

- WebShell SSH on   Port:12320
- Webmin On         Port:12321
- Adminer DBMgr on  Port: 12322
- Optional HTTPS: WebConsole:Port: 12324
- Optional HTTP WebConsole:  Port: 12325

  All management is linked from Webconsole as well as cursory documentation.

- PHP, Python and Perl support for Apache2 and PostgreSQL.
- `Adminer`_ administration frontend for PostgreSQL (listening on
  port 12322 - uses SSL).
  
- Webmin modules for configuring Apache2, PHP and PostgreSQL and system details.
- PostgreSQL listening on localhost (security)
- PostgreSQL password encryption enabled by default (security).
- The *postgres* user is trusted when connecting over local unix sockets
  (convenience).
- `Odoo`_ instaled branch: **8.0**.
- Odoo secured connection (http (port 80) auto redirects to https(port 443)).

- Odoo connection (listening on port 8069 -  Set up by default to open only to localhost).
  - You may want to Open this and can do so by going to /opt/openerp/odoo/openerp-server.conf
    removing 127.0.0.1 from "xmlrpc_interface = 127.0.0.1" and "netrpc_interface = 127.0.0.1"
    This will allow you to separate SSL Configuration from Odoo Configuration.
